## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there !

This pong project is a basic project that allowed me to learn how to use [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to manage the use of libraries. I learned how to make a small game with an interface using [JavaFx 14](https://openjfx.io/).

Do not hesitate to suggest improvements for this program ðŸ˜€
